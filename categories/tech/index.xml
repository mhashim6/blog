But also in this particular context I&amp;rsquo;m known as mhashim6. And this is a breakdown of some of my FOSS projects and how they&amp;rsquo;re used by the devs of the GitHub community.
This data was obtained using GitHub&amp;rsquo;s global code search utility.
Open Hadith Data When I first made this, there was no actual open and free dataset for Hadith (الأحاديث النبوية). And this was the objective of this repo.</description></item><item><title>Gossips: An Event-Bus in a Chatty Neighborhood</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/metaphorical-programming-gossips-event-bus/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 11:11:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/metaphorical-programming-gossips-event-bus/</guid><description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll tackle a common issue: simple communication between system components. With a slightly controversial, themed, domain-driven design.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say our project is an Android app, and we need a functionality that requires two fragments to communicate. You know Android, social distancing between components is the norm out there. We&amp;rsquo;ll use this as an excuse to write an Event Bus.
I chose an analogy for the entire thing: Gossips; It fits with the nature of the library, and the way it&amp;rsquo;ll be used–A global pub-sub component to enable cross-component communication.</description></item><item><title>Creating a project amidst a world crisis</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/pm-in-crisis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/pm-in-crisis/</guid><description>May, 20, 2020 The past three months were a completely new experience to us; We (13 CSE undergrads) set out to build an Open online Quran reciting and teaching platform.
We didn’t know of the upcoming global circumstances when we planned the project. We haven’t seen each other (physically) in the project’s entire lifetime. Due to social distancing. The project was initially a school assignment. We were to simulate a database project, and the school set the deadline to be 2 months.</description></item></channel></rss>
