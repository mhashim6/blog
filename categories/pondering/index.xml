It&amp;rsquo;s a real blessing to have such relatively-long off-work time. And this very fact is a problem!
I remember 3-4 years ago I&amp;rsquo;d often feel sad at the weekend because now I&amp;rsquo;m forced to stop doing the activities I loved, be it college projects, gatherings and believe it or not work. I remember me doing side-projects on weekends as if I was just playing a video game; I&amp;rsquo;d never notice the passing of time, nor the effort I spent on these projects.</description></item><item><title>Bereft</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/2022/05/03/sharing-my-sorrow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/2022/05/03/sharing-my-sorrow/</guid><description>Why would people share how they feel with the entire world? Is it normal to hang a sign on a central wall saying that Mr.Doe is not happy? It’s quite normal when it comes to family and closed ones. But the entire world?
Now indeed it’s encouraged to share one’s feelings and opinions for everyone to see and discuss. It’s perceived as normal by many. Some say it’s therapeutic. Some accept and welcome the new change and adopt it, following the spirit of trying new things.</description></item></channel></rss>
