To answer this we&rsquo;ll have to talk about OOP<em>(bear with me)</em>. Before OOP, data was put in dummy bags. call it<code>structs</code>,<code>JSON Objects</code> or whatever, it&rsquo;s essentially a bag. In complex apps<em>(just like with life)</em> abstraction hides away lots of complexity and makes us pay attention to the problem at hand.</p><p>To operate on such bags, we write functions that use values from this bag to produce another bag or a primitive value</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kr">const</span><span class="nx">user</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">username</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">"mhashim6"</span><span class="p">,</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">firstName</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">"Muhammad"</span><span class="p">,</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">lastName</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">"Hashim"</span><span class="p">,</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">email</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">"msg at mhashim6.me"</span><span class="p">,</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">};</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"/></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kr">const</span><span class="nx">fullName</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">user</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="p">=></span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nx">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">firstName</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sb"/><span class="si">${</span><span class="nx">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">lastName</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="p">;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Imagine having only these 2 language features to create your complex representations. How cumbersome and redundant would it be to<u>instantiate</u> multiple users and operate on them without<strong>having globals everywhere</strong> and worrying about which instance still lives and which is no longer needed.</p><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be much more intuitive to make these data bags<strong>contextual</strong> with their corresponding functionality implicitly tied to the context or the state of the data? This is partially why OOP was designed—to make objects contextual &amp; less dumb. To abstract away most of the data bag content and have contextual actions (methods) instead, much like our real-world objects.</p><h2 id="enter-oop">Enter OOP</h2><p>With OOP, you could combine data and functionality in an abstraction called<code>Object</code></p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kr">class</span><span class="nx">User</span><span class="p">{</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">constructor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">username</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">firstName</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">lastName</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">email</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="p">{</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">username</span><span class="p">;</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">firstName</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">firstName</span><span class="p">;</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">lastName</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">lastName</span><span class="p">;</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">email</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">email</span><span class="p">;</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"/></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">fullName</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="p">=></span><span class="s2">"${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}"</span><span class="p">;</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice here,<code>fullName</code> no longer receives a parameter; it&rsquo;s bound to a context (constructor parameters that are stored as fields).

Over the span of 10 years, apps have drastically changed; one could see how much the industry evolved and practices changed by gutting through the internals.</p><p>Goes without saying, this is a weird way to contemplate the industry, and many insights can be easily obtained and analysed in more direct ways. However, it’s always fascinating to look<em>(at anything)</em> through the microscope.</p><h2 id="how-it-began">How it began</h2><p>In 2012 I was a zealous<em>&ldquo;tweaker&rdquo;</em>, not in the narcotic sense of course, but in Software. Owning an Android phone with a sense of control over everything like in a linux box. In the golden age of rooting and flashing the living bits out of a device.</p><p>I’ve always enjoyed customising my devices and making everything to my liking. Open as it is, you can’t go further with Android without getting your hands dirty. You have to modify system apps and processes. And without much knowledge of a particular app codebase, I’d find myself reading through obfuscated<code>assembly</code>/<code>smali</code> to make sense of things.</p><p>Getting used to particular app architectures and conventions, things tend to get easier to identify and amend. App protection techniques slowly become simple patterns and routines. App layers and 3rd party packages are almost the same at a high level. And you can know your way without much zooming in.</p><h2 id="from-binary-to-css">From binary to CSS</h2><p>Apps in the past would heavily rely on native c(++) code to share and reuse logic. The Android framework wasn’t as mature as today<em>(I know, it’s never matured)</em>. And performance was a key differentiator; a tiny memory boost resulted a thousand users more. Saving a 0.5 MB of app size would yield better listing and visibility on the App Store.</p><p>Java was a shell and almost everything else would be a shared compiled lib. The parts you could tweak were almost exclusive to the Android framework APIs.</p><p>Luckily, the OS became<em>(slightly)</em> better, and hardware is almost miraculous now. Everything is more powerful and smaller. And the community became more fluent<em>(more adapted TBH)</em> in the Android Framework. Many pieces of android logic have been written in libraries and being depended upon in almost every app.</p><h3 id="native-era">Native Era</h3><p>Many projects understood the value of native development and were willing to work on 2 codebases for Android and iOS as need be. But cost and maintainability were ever so problematic. Some teams would find a huge gap between both platforms. The Facebook app still suffers from this till this very day.</p><p>Apps were never easier to analyse and reason about. I could introduce vast changes to almost any obfuscated app and make whatever I want. And I could imagine how this translates to great readability and maintainability across engineers and teams working on this app. Products can grow at a speed never seen before—Even reverse engineers benefitted from the readability and maturity of the Framework.</p><h3 id="cross-platform">Cross Platform</h3><p>Like sharing static libs, teams always strived to reuse logic across platforms. Many ways and frameworks were created to solve the same issue. It became the name of the game. Apps were no longer pure encoded sources, they became this jungle of bundles and autogenerated fillings that glue things together.</p><p>Not because it made reverse engineering harder, but it seemed that things took a very complex turn to manage simplicity. Apps were no longer a function of product needs. The framework became a factor in the formula itself. Teams are developing for the framework, and slightly for the product.</p><h3 id="the-underdog">The underdog</h3><p>Other technologies faced drastic changes as well. The glorious web seemed like we never knew its true potential. And it is ever better in creating UIs. And the community has always wanted to make everything a website. The web<em>(not to mention machine learning)</em> benefited the most from hardware advancements.</p><p>Not only did they prove to be significantly more cost effective,<code>webviews</code> in apps also matured and these days almost all apps rely on them. And<strong>&ldquo;native-shell-web-core&rdquo;</strong> apps are now quite popular. In giant corporate apps, it’s almost impossible to dissect an app without finding yourself staring at a web-based feature/slice.</p><h2 id="commentary">Commentary</h2><p><em>“Web is the future!”</em> is as true as it’s annoying. Their are all types of tools and solutions to solve app problems (Reusability, Simplicity, and Appeal).</p><p>But it seems if you’re looking for a compromise, the web is actually quite good.

I know you guys have a nice imagination, otherwise you'd not have picked<code>jsx</code> to stare at most of your life. So I need you to just imagine that every<code>&lt;div></code> is just a<code>&lt;View></code> and go along with this. Nothing here is specific to<code>reactjs</code>. It's just React.</p></details><h2 id="the-props-distribution-issue">The Props distribution issue</h2><p>You&rsquo;re a good React dev, you want to reuse as much of your components while still maintaining standardised layouts and characteristics.</p><p>So you have multiple Pages/Screens in your app. They&rsquo;re mostly similar in layout but can still be a bit different to suit their needs. And that&rsquo;s the mark of the good designer on your team.</p><p>There&rsquo;re many ways to make individual screens maintain the overall app style while being unique. For instance, there could be some common components like a header or a footer; some common styling like a colour accent per screen that matches the overall colour platte of the app.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-jsx" data-lang="jsx"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kr">const</span><span class="nx">Screen</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="nx">themeColor</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">children</span><span class="p">})</span><span class="p">=></span><span class="p">(</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">></span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">Header</span><span class="na">themeColor</span><span class="p">/></span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">{...</span><span class="nx">children</span><span class="p">}</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">Footer</span><span class="na">themeColor</span><span class="p">/></span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">></span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">);</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>But this screen should be composed of multiple types of components that have their own responsibilities.

This is about how to be a<strong>R</strong>esponsible<strong>G</strong>it<strong>U</strong>ser. Or in short, how to<em><strong>RGU</strong></em><em>(see what I did there?)</em></p><h2 id="micro-commits">Micro commits</h2><blockquote><p>Because no one wants to deal with a dump<em>(of anything)</em>.</p></blockquote><p>You see, a well-behaved Git user won’t dump a truckload worth of changes in one single commit. You see, managing a whole dump is never fun; dumps are made to stay the way they are: dumps.</p><p>The only transformation you can apply to a dump is to either shape it into a smelly cube to later stack it in a rather symmetric-looking bigger dump, or if you’re a bit flexible you’d typically burn it and pretend it never was. Because no one wants to deal with a dump<em>(of anything)</em>.</p><p>Instead of putting all your heart in one big concentrated dose and having it broken in the end, make gradual steps to give yourself<em>(and your<del>loved ones</del> teammates)</em> a space to reflect, assess and change.</p><h2 id="scoped-contextual-commits">Scoped/ Contextual Commits</h2><p>Okay, now your commits are smaller and easier to manage and review… Wait! At what cost?
Did you make one commit per file? Our goal was not to replace the dump with a chunk of smaller-in-size meaningless dumps; actually, the original dump was easier to manage believe it or not.</p><blockquote><p>It’s hardly big of a change, and it’s well-scoped and makes sense on its own.</p></blockquote><p>You should instead put more effort into selecting what parts/ files to include in your commit before creating it. For example, You created functionality that relies on some random factor like time.</p><p>Now as a responsible engineer you probably created the logic that provides this random factor and wrote some tests for it. Now it’d make sense to include this random function in its own commit; It’s hardly big of a change, and it’s well-scoped and makes sense on its own.</p><h2 id="valid-sane-commits">Valid/ Sane Commits</h2><p>Doing better already! But<em>bro does it even build?</em>
Remember our last example? Of course you do I was just trying to patronise you<em>(and it seems to be working, eh?)</em> We had two components: A component that merely exists to make my point, and a random-time-function-thingy. Each with their tests of course as a responsible engineer.</p><blockquote><p>You’ve produced a history that doesn’t even compile!</p></blockquote><p>Now, what files would you commit first? The random thingy<em>(with its tests)</em> or the fake component<em>(with its tests)</em> that depends on the random thingy? If you commit the component without its dependency then you’ve produced a history that doesn’t even compile! Have we not had enough of that already?</p><p>You should always try your best to have a valid and sane history tree; this immensely helps with recovery, traceability, and stability. It’s also basic CI so you get to flex about the buzzwords with your mates!</p><h2 id="self-explanatory-commits-that-summarise-what-they-do">Self-explanatory Commits that summarise what they do</h2><h2 id="its-not-supposed-to-be-write-only">It’s not supposed to be write-only</h2><p>You’d be amazed to see how many hours one can spend reading a Git history to find when something was done. Now you’ll shout at me:<em>just use<code>blame</code> bro!</em> But I’m afraid sometimes even blame can’t do any good with long, and corrupt histories<em>(Yes I’m very pleased with myself right now)</em>.</p><p>But if you’re a Responsible Git User and you’re investing time in your commits and thinking of them in the grand scheme of things (basically other teammates playing their role in your common history). The history tree will be much simpler and cleaner to the degree that you might be able to blame each other (in corporate) again! Yay!</p><h2 id="historic-timeline">Historic Timeline</h2><blockquote><p>Minor details should be there only if you look for them.</p></blockquote><p>You finally get the chance to write History!<em>(I know enough of this joke already it wasn’t even this funny)</em> But what do you write? everything? or EVERYTHING? or important, notable things?</p><p>I’m sure many throughout History have sneezed but I bet you were not told that about any famous character in history class.
Not every single detail needs to be available at first sight. Minor details should be there only if you look for them, leaving space for major events and changes.</p><p>Using the previous example one last time, once you’re done with the fake component (and its tests) and you’re ready to add it to the main tree, take a pause, think about this change in a slightly higher-level context and squash the closely related commits into a slightly bigger commit.</p><p>This way the main tree is not flooded with micro commits that served their purpose long ago, and yet you preserved the dozen commits that highlight the major event that you induced. Lovely!</p><hr><p>Do you know better ways to<strong><em>RGU</em></strong>? let’s argue in the comments!<em>(sorry one last time)</em>.</p></description></item><item><title>Hello, Winter!</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/hello-winter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/hello-winter/</guid><description><blockquote><p>Hello, Winter!<br>

It can be overwhelming to start reading them so I’ll try my best to maintain this thread about how to approach (some of) Tolkien’s works:</p><ul><li><a href="#the-children-of-hurin">The Children of Húrin</a></li><li><a href="#the-fall-of-gondolin">The Fall of Gondolin</a></li><li><a href="#the-hobbit-and-lotr">The Hobbit &amp; The Lord of The Rings</a></li><li><a href="#beren-and-luthien">Beren and Lúthien (and The Lay of Leithian)</a></li><li><a href="#silmarillion">The Silmarillion (and The Book of Lost Tales)</a></li></ul><p>This ordering might be confusing but to my experience it is quite luring. The Hobbit and LOTR are well known and most of us have watched the movies<em>(Even though they are so far from the books but still the main storyline is there)</em> so I’d say save it for later when you are more immersed in the world of “Middle Earth”.</p><h2 id="the-children-of-hurin">Starting with<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/597790.The_Children_of_H_rin">The Children of Húrin</a></h2><p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51l0B3EVhPL.jpg" alt="book cover">
I believe this is best way to enter Tolkien’s world; It’s so rich in raw emotions and lore. It features a rich mix of the world’s races and struggles. In a tragic fantasy<em>(make no mistake, Tolkien’s works are dark fantasy and often sway far from merry)</em> about fate, redemption and psychological strength with a sheer reflection on our world, as the main characters are mere humans.</p><h2 id="the-fall-of-gondolin"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39798828-the-fall-of-gondolin">The Fall of Gondolin</a></h2><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xsQ4ZFKdL.jpg" alt="book cover">
This one is rather short, compared to other Tolkien stories. However, it&rsquo;s one of the best examples of the extreme lengths Tolkien goes through when he sets a scene. Here he sets many scenes of life phases: childhood, conflict, glory, and fatality.</p><p>The hidden city of Gondolin remains the most remembered fictional city in the world with its iconic feats.</p><h2 id="the-hobbit-and-lotr">The Hobbit &amp; LOTR</h2><p><img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/03QAAOSwVEpf~tzH/s-l640.jpg" alt="book cover">
It&rsquo;s safe to assume that almost everyone is familiar with these through Peter Jackson’s films. Though most of the main plot points are featured in the films, the books differ greatly in events, themes, and overall sensation.</p><p>The books are much darker and focus more on both the cerebral and emotional aspects of conflicts.<br>
They&rsquo;re also the lengthiest in Tolkien&rsquo;s works.</p><h2 id="beren-and-luthien">Of<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41015249-beren-and-l-thien">Beren and Lúthien</a> (And The Lay of Leithian)</h2><p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51voxpKiEDL.jpg" alt="book cover"/><p>This (of all things) is actually a Romance story. As dark as Tolkien’s world is, its romance is no different. The events of which lead to the major situation in The world, later found in<em>“The Hobbit”</em> and “<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>” Thousands of years after.<br>
It tells about struggle, sacrifice, prejudice, and soaring above made-up boundaries.</p><p>This one is so special, because it exists in two forms:</p><ol><li>A book, extracted from “<em>The Silmarillion</em>” .</li><li>A<strong>Poem</strong>; Tolkien was always impressed by<strong>the Greek Iliad</strong> and wanted to challenge<strong>writing an epic entirely in Poetry</strong>. It’s called the “<strong><em>Lay of Leithian</em></strong>” It’s literally one of the most impressive poems in the English Literature that inspired many Poets and Songs.</li></ol><h2 id="silmarillion"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7332.The_Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</a> (and The Lost Tales)</h2><p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41k+B4mxcCL.jpg" alt="book cover"/><p>This is the end of our journey. The Silmarillion records the history of the world. There, Tolkien talked about how the world was created, major events that lead to our current world, and a high-level perspective on the tales described in his other books.<br>
It contains detailed historical backgrounds and descriptions of the world; its languages and geography; and the people. It’s considered the book of books in Tolkien’s works.</p><p>There is a<strong>misconception</strong> about &ldquo;The Silmarillion&rdquo;: Some think that you can’t navigate through Tolkien’s world without first reading it. This is anything but right; The Silmarillion was published much later than other books. Plus it’s written in a<strong>completely different style</strong> that is detailed and<strong>overwhelming</strong> to anyone not familiar with the world. In fact, you shouldn’t read the Silmarillion unless you feel like you want to know the full story. Other than that, You can read all other works just fine.</p><p><strong>The Book of Lost Tales</strong> contains other notes and drafts that Tolkien wrote but never published. Later, his family compiled these tales and published them in this series.</p><hr><p>You can comment your thoughts below using nothing but Telegram.</p></description></item><item><title>The Missing Docs on CircleCI (+Shell)</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/circleci-shell-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/circleci-shell-guide/</guid><description><h1 id="the-missing-docs-on-circleci--shell">The Missing Docs on CircleCI (+ Shell)</h1><p>Hi there!

The catch is that this parameter can be only determined in runtime (Say a script result or network response). How to do this in CircleCI?</p><p><strong>The short version</strong>: You can’t.<br><strong>Why?</strong> Because since CircleCI v2.1 all parameters will be inflated at parse time and not in runtime. Which means that little script result of yours is now just a script. Which means you’ve passed a script invocation as CircleCI dumb parameter. I hope you’re proud of yourself now.</p><p><strong>Workaround:</strong> One of the things CircleCI did so right was to allow passing<code>steps</code> as parameters to a CircleCI<code>command</code> (think higher-order functions). Using this, instead of passing the script (result) as a parameter, pass the<code>step</code> that calls this script as a parameter and it automatically runs in the same context as the command. Which means you can access the created files and the<code>env</code> of the job and the command.</p><p>Here, an example:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">post-github-release</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">description</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/><span class="l">Post a release to GitHub repo</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">parameters</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">sdk-builder</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">type</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/><span class="l">steps</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">default</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/><span class="p">[]</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">is-pre-release</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">type</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/><span class="l">boolean</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">default</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/><span class="kc">false</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">company</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">type</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/><span class="l">string</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">default</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/><span class="l">internal</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/><span class="nt">steps</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/>-<span class="w"/><span class="nt">steps</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/><span class="l">&lt;&lt; parameters.sdk-builder >></span><span class="w"/></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"/>-<span class="w"/><span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"/><span class="l">./bla_bla_bla.sh</span><span class="w"/></span></span></code></pre></div><p>See that?<code>sdk-builder</code> is a<del>lambda</del><code>step</code> that gets dynamically invoked based on the caller of this<code>command</code>.

Tolkien is a master of detail and vast imagination. I&rsquo;ve always been fond of his world and the vivid imagery he projects with his words.<br>
His poetry is the perfect complement to his imagination. So I thought I might get tiny glimpses of his world using modern ML image-gen engines. And I was really blessed with the results.</p><h3 id="the-song-of-eärendil">The Song of Eärendil</h3><p><img src="/images/imagined/mhashim6_earendil.png" alt="by mhashim6" title="by mhashim6"/><blockquote><p>From World&rsquo;s End there he turned away,<br>
and yearned again to find afar<br>
his home through shadows journeying,<br>
and burning as an island star<br>
on high above the mists he came,<br>
a distant flame before the Sun,<br>
a wonder ere the waking dawn<br>
where grey the Norland waters run.</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="kortirion-among-the-trees">Kortirion among the Trees</h3><p>Here I had a happy accident, I used a short part from the poem stripping it off its context to generate an image.

The gliding water leaves these inland realms,<br>
And slips between long meadows to the Sea —<br>
Still bearing downward over murmurous falls</p></blockquote><p>However, when I used it in its original context the result was on the literal end of the spectrum.</p><p><img src="/images/imagined/mhashim6_kor_1.png" alt="by mhashim6" title="by mhashim6"/><blockquote><p>O fading town upon an island hill,<br>
Old shadows linger in thine ancient gate,<br>
Thy robe is grey, thine old heart now is still;<br>
Thy towers silent in the mist await their crumbling end,</p><p>While through the storeyed elms<br>
The gliding water leaves these inland realms,<br>
And slips between long meadows to the Sea —<br>
Still bearing downward over murmurous falls<br>
One day and then another to the Sea;<br>
And slowly thither many years have gone,<br>
Since first the Elves here built<strong>Kortirion</strong>.</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="habbanan-beneath-the-stars">Habbanan beneath the Stars</h3><p><img src="/images/imagined/mhashim6_habbanan.png" alt="by mhashim6" title="by mhashim6"/><blockquote><p>A globe of dark glass faceted with light<br>

such there is night.</p></blockquote><p><img src="/images/imagined/mhashim6_such-there-is-night.png" alt="by mhashim6" title="by mhashim6"/><blockquote><p>Not night as ours, unhappy folk,<br>

In fact, it is relatively new. &ldquo;Oneliness&rdquo; on the other hand had always been there, meaning one&rsquo;s being alone. It&rsquo;s considered obsolete now in modern English. But it could be a perfect description of the state of many; There&rsquo;s a case for people who are lonely, yet not alone. And the exact opposite.</p><p>Many are familiar with that feeling, summarized as just not being surrounded by the<em>&ldquo;right&rdquo;</em> people–people who wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate a talk of opening-up, or people that are not particularly interested, or people who are absolutely compassionate and supportive, but really have nothing to offer.</p><p>Many throughout history have expressed this feeling, even before the<del>&ldquo;right&rdquo;</del> words existed. And they put it like no one could ever do.
Though Tomas Turner was surrounded by friends. And yet, after the passing of his wife (whom he called his<em>&ldquo;only friend&rdquo;</em>), he wrote in his diary, he felt<em>&ldquo;deserted&rdquo;</em></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not one, no! not one that attempts to pour that healing balm of compassion into a heart wounded and torn to pieces with trouble. Whenever it shall please the almighty to take from me the wife of my bosom, then shall I be like a beacon upon a rock, or an ensign on a hill, destitute of every sincere friend, and not a friendly companion left to comfort my afflicted mind and yield that pleasing comfort of consolation to a mind quite worn to the grave with trouble.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The modernist English writer Virginia Woolf wrote of her own loneliness in 1928 in her diary</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have entered into a sanctuary… of great agony once; and always some terror: so afraid one is of loneliness: of seeing to the bottom of the vessel… and got then to a consciousness of what I call &lsquo;reality&rsquo;… something abstract, but residing in the downs or sky; beside which nothing matters.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Plath struggled for a sense of belonging that was constantly just out of reach</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates… despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter – they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>If you have this one person that scares the loneliness out of you.

It&rsquo;s a real blessing to have such relatively-long off-work time. And this very fact is a problem!</p><p><strong>I remember</strong> 3-4 years ago I&rsquo;d often feel sad at the weekend because now I&rsquo;m forced to stop doing the activities I loved, be it college projects, gatherings and<em>believe it or not</em> work.<strong>I remember</strong> me doing side-projects on weekends as if I was just playing a video game; I&rsquo;d never notice the passing of time, nor the effort I spent on these projects.</p><p><strong>I remember</strong> years ago when I&rsquo;d even work on weekends just because that freelance gig is so interesting I actually love every second of working on it. Or I&rsquo;m really enjoying the company of my work mates to the extent I spend the weekend with them. Much like a father movie character waiting for the weekends to finish that shelf. But now? It&rsquo;s<em>unfortunately</em> completely different.</p><p>In my life I noticed there are two reasons to take a break (besides emergencies and what not):</p><ul><li>Pause, Have fun, Recharge, Reflect, etc&hellip;</li><li>RUN!</li></ul><p>The first one is sweet and understandable. Even if we had nothing to do for months we&rsquo;d still get that urge of spending time breaking the routine (no matter how lazy it is). Much different from the other one, where I feel completely broken, worn out like a fainting kindle and I just can&rsquo;t take it (sometimes physically) for even one more minute.</p><p>Now this is really bad, this means I&rsquo;m<em><del>willingly?</del> forced</em> to do something that I dread, and hanging in there till I can no longer do it. I&rsquo;m sinking my head in the tub for seconds before I automatically pull out my head so as not to drown&hellip;and die.</p><p>This will not end with the secret elixir I&rsquo;m afraid. And so are most of my writings. But I&rsquo;ll end this praying I&rsquo;m once again working while being not&hellip;sad, taking vacations only to pause, have fun, recharge, and reflect.</p></description></item><item><title>Bereft</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/sharing-my-sorrow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/sharing-my-sorrow/</guid><description><p>Why would people share how they feel with the entire world? Is it normal to hang a sign on a central wall saying that<em>Mr.Doe</em> is not happy? It’s quite normal when it comes to family and closed ones. But the entire world?</p><p>Now indeed it’s encouraged to share one’s feelings and opinions for everyone to see and discuss. It’s perceived as normal by many. Some say it’s therapeutic. Some accept and welcome the new change and adopt it, following the spirit of trying new things. I can understand this. I’m quite bored myself. But I won’t deny I get this urge to share how sad I am from time to time. I never do it, and I keep thinking why do I<del>need</del> want to do it in the first place!</p><p>I also noticed that it’s not about sharing how I feel in general; this kind of attention doesn’t thrill me, nor is sought for any reason at all. But when it comes to sorrow, I get this urge. When I’m that sad I tend to stay by myself. And this is hard to maintain when everyone assumes that I’m perfectly fine. Maybe I want to share it so that people leave me be. Maybe it<em>does</em> relieve some pain when I talk about it however slight.</p><p>This is a blog after all, so maybe I could be more personal and share how I feel. I don’t know if this will<em>help</em> at all. Or if it is even supposed to help in the first place. But here it is: I’m sad, too sad actually it’s getting to my physical health.</p><p>I’ve always found<em>Tolkien’s</em> description of<em>Elves</em> very clever and somewhat relatable to real world’s humans;<em>Elves</em> are immortal, yet they can get killed, or die of grief and sorrow.</p></description></item><item><title>Why?</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 11:11:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/about/</guid><description><blockquote><p><strong>Why did I make this?</strong><br>

The past three months were a completely new experience to us; We (13 CSE undergrads) set out to build an Open online Quran reciting and teaching platform.</p></blockquote><p>We didn’t know of the upcoming global circumstances when we planned the project. We haven’t seen each other (physically) in the project’s entire lifetime.<strong>Due to social distancing</strong>. The project was initially<strong>a school assignment</strong>. We were to simulate a database project, and the school set the deadline to be 2 months. Till our final exams original date.<strong>But we wanted to build a real-world application</strong>.</p><p>We planned to finish phase 1 of the project in 2 months, 8 sprints. But things would have been different if we had a fortune teller in the team. But they don’t actually exist. It’s no secret that we were under-prepared. Our first sprint was basically “studying”. We knew it isn’t enough. But it should give us a modest kick start. And it did.</p><p>Besides my role as a team lead, I was the scrum master (and it was a new role for me). I had to take Coursera’s 5-Course Product Management Specialization to better understand the role.<strong>But I consider this project the real course in product management</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Morale was the toughest factor to keep<em><strong>up</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Our team was completely new to the agile<del>manifesto</del> process. We had to adapt and change some habits in these trying times. We experimented with different approaches in managing the project and adapting to the current horrible circumstances. Morale was the toughest factor to keep<em><strong>up</strong></em>; things seemed to only go worse. Besides our morale and psychological health, we also faced physical health issues in Ramadan. Coordination and communication grew even harder.</p><p>Despite all these horrible facts, we didn’t (completely) fail; though we didn’t deliver phase 1 in time. We didn’t blow up what was completed, quality was always the priority.<strong>Testing wasn’t optional</strong>. Every functionality is considered done after<strong>code review and automated tests have been written and passed</strong>. Client interaction was maintained as much as we could.</p><p>Though we are in our final sprint, and though we failed from the project’s point of view, but we gained a lot of knowledge. And now that we have this experience. We will resume working on the project after taking what we&rsquo;ve learned, and what went wrong into consideration; after making the necessary changes.</p><p><img src="/images/sprints.png" alt="Six of our weekly-sprints.
