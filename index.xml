It&amp;rsquo;s a real blessing to have such relatively-long off-work time. And this very fact is a problem!
I remember 3-4 years ago I&amp;rsquo;d often feel sad at the weekend because now I&amp;rsquo;m forced to stop doing the activities I loved, be it college projects, gatherings and believe it or not work. I remember me doing side-projects on weekends as if I was just playing a video game; I&amp;rsquo;d never notice the passing of time, nor the effort I spent on these projects.</description></item><item><title>Bereft</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/2022/05/03/sharing-my-sorrow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/2022/05/03/sharing-my-sorrow/</guid><description>Why would people share how they feel with the entire world? Is it normal to hang a sign on a central wall saying that Mr.Doe is not happy? It’s quite normal when it comes to family and closed ones. But the entire world?
Now indeed it’s encouraged to share one’s feelings and opinions for everyone to see and discuss. It’s perceived as normal by many. Some say it’s therapeutic. Some accept and welcome the new change and adopt it, following the spirit of trying new things.</description></item><item><title>Why?</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 11:11:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/about/</guid><description> Why did I make this?
This place hosts writings that are not bound to a specific time, nor a region. It hosts my notions, thoughts, and recordings of my life and labour.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/contact/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 11:11:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/contact/</guid><description>Don’t fill this out if you’re human: Name Email Message Send</description></item><item><title>Gossips: An Event-Bus in a Chatty Neighborhood</title><link>https://blog.mhashim6.me/2020/06/19/metaphorical-programming-gossips-event-bus/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 11:11:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mhashim6.me/2020/06/19/metaphorical-programming-gossips-event-bus/</guid><description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll tackle a common issue: simple communication between system components. With a slightly controversial, themed, domain-driven design.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say our project is an Android app, and we need a functionality that requires two fragments to communicate. You know Android, social distancing between components is the norm out there. We&amp;rsquo;ll use this as an excuse to write an Event Bus.
I chose an analogy for the entire thing: Gossips; It fits with the nature of the library, and the way it&amp;rsquo;ll be used–A global pub-sub component to enable cross-component communication.</description></item></channel></rss>
