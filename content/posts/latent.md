> Muffled, and low \
> Dimmed behind the glow \
> Latent—can’t blow \
> Caged, ticking to go\
> Loud cries arose
>
> Stories to tell \
> Misfit and ill \
> Latent—lest it perils \
> Recorded, in seals it dwells \
> There it lies, upon a rusty sill
>
> Guilt is weighing on \
> The burden is all grown \
> Latent—Can’t be thrown \
> Embodied, crushing bone \
> The way to die alone
>
