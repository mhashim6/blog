> Hello, Winter!  
> What took thee so long?  
> I pray all’s well,  
> Come sit along  
> Tell us of the pains  
> Thou carried all along  
> Since yesteryear  
> And the years long gone  
> 
> The memories fade not  
> The nightmares linger on  
> Did the days not grow dark,  
> Nor the shadows grew long?  
> Tell me now, Winter!  
> Am I so wrong?  
> 
> Come, O’ Winter!  
> Pour thy rain  
> Wash me clean  
> And carry my pain  
> For I’m not certain  
> If I will meet thee, Winter,  
> When thou dost visit, again.
>
