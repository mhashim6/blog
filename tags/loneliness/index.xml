In fact, it is relatively new. &amp;ldquo;Oneliness&amp;rdquo; on the other hand had always been there, meaning one&amp;rsquo;s being alone. It&amp;rsquo;s considered obsolete now in modern English. But it could be a perfect description of the state of many; There&amp;rsquo;s a case for people who are lonely, yet not alone. And the exact opposite.
Many are familiar with that feeling, summarized as just not being surrounded by the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; peopleâ€“people who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t tolerate a talk of opening-up, or people that are not particularly interested, or people who are absolutely compassionate and supportive, but really have nothing to offer.</description></item></channel></rss>
