Yet every year, red flags kept on showing and it always seemed too good to be true. And now that the trailer is here, I can confirm: This show is awful.
I was really looking forward to this show, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been an avid reader of Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s every piece of literature. And the &amp;ldquo;Rings of Power&amp;rdquo; is a rude insult to the world that Tolkien created.</description></item></channel></rss>
